# Relationship-Between-COVID-19-and-Human-Behavior
Analyzing the Relationship Between COVID-19 and Human Behavior using Multiple Datasets

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on human behavior, including changes in social interactions, mobility patterns, and healthcare-seeking behaviors. In this project proposal, we aim to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 and human behavior using multiple datasets. We will analyze four datasets, including Twitter dataset, COVID-19 Cases, Google search trends, and Google Map Mobility Reports, to explore how the pandemic has affected people's behavior. By understanding how COVID-19 has affected people's behavior, we can better prepare for future pandemics and improve public health policies.
